# Package Delivery Algorithm - Nearest Neighbor.
### This is a project for my Data Structures and Algorithm course. This project implements a custom hash table and uses Nearest Neighbor Algorithm to calculate and create a delivery route. The project ultilizes self-adjusting data structures and dynamic programming.
